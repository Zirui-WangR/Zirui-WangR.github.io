In order to grasp the essentials of _STOCHASTIC CALCULUS_, the first prequisite would be to understand proability with **_MEASURE THEORY_**. 

___
# **MEASURE THEORY**
*PART 1 σ-ALGEBRA*

Assume that X is any set. **P(X)** is the power set of teh set X, whcih means that it is the set that contains all the subsets of X. 
<center>

  *For example*

X = {a,b}

P(X) = {&#8709;, X, {a}, {b}}

</center>

**Def. 1 (<u>Measurable Sets</u>)** $\mathcal{A}$ &sube; P(X) is a colelction of subsets. It is called a σ-algebra iff: 
  
  1) X &isin; $\mathcal{A}$
  
  2) A &isin; $\mathcal{A}$ &Rightarrow; A<sup>C</sup> &isin; $\mathcal{A}$
  
  3) A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, ..., A<sub>n</sub> &isin; $\mathcal{A}$ &Rightarrow; U<sup>∞</sup><sub>i=1</sub> A<sub>i</sub> &isin; $\mathcal{A}$, (n &isin; &#8469;) (means there could be countable inifite number of A's)
